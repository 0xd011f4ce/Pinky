* Pinky

[[https://pinky-lang.org/][Pinky]] is a very little and simple programming language. I wanted to write an
interpreter and a compiler for it, as I think it would be a really neat
programming language to write these two things for.

The code might not be the state-of-art, as I am focusing more on doing the
compiler, than doing optimised code. Of course, as soon as I notice that
something can be improved, I'll do it.

** TO-DO

As of now, practically nothing has been made xd.

- [-] Lexer: I am working on it. For now it supports almost everything but
  keywords.
- [ ] Parser: I haven't started it.
- [ ] Interpreter
  - [ ] REPL
- [ ] Code generation
  - [ ] Should I do some IR?
- [ ] Make it cool :sunglasses:
